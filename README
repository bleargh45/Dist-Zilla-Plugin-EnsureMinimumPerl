NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EnsureMinimumPerl - Ensure that you have specified
    a minimum version of Perl

SYNOPSIS

      # In your dist.ini
      [EnsureMinimumPerl]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin checks to ensure that you have specified a
    minimum required version of Perl, before allowing you to perform a
    release.

    I kept forgetting to be explicit about this in my own releases, and so
    I whipped this up to force me to do it.
